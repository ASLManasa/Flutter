LETS MOVE ON WITH DART FURTHER...
WE WILL NOW DEAL WITH CLASSES..IN DART
-->
PROGRAM
void main(){
student s1 = student();
print(s1.name);
print(s1.age);
s1.attend();
}
class student{
int age =12;
string name ="abc";
void attend{
print("attendence marked");
}
}
??TASK : TRY CREATING 2 USERS AND INVOKE THE METHODS AND VARIABLE??


NOW LETS DEAL WITH CONSTRUCTOR..
WHAT IS A CONSTRUCTOR?.. A constructor is invoked when an object is created. constructor should have the same name as the class name..
PROGRAM:

void main(){
student s1 = student();
print(s1.name);
print(s1.age);
s1.attend();
}
class student{
int age ;
string name ;
student(string name,int age){
this.name=name;
this.age=age;
}//this is a consturctor
void attend{
print("attendence marked");
}
}

//we can pass unique names and age.
